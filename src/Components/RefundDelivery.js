After ordering, you are entitled to receive a refill for any service that has not been fully completed or has seen a drop in order quantity.

Upon successful payment, your order will be processed and fulfilled as soon as possible. This usually occurs within a few hours but can take as long as five days. If your order has not been completed within two days, please contact our support team via email and a customer support agent will look into the delay.</p></div></div></main></main>
